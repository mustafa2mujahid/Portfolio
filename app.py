            In the month of March 2024, when I was worried about the final exams, vivas, submissions which was commencing from 24 April. A news about LogiTHON spread like a wildfire in our institute. Everyone around me was talking about it. I came to know that it was just a hackathon and I at that time was not personally interested to take part in it. But the reward of winning the hackathon caught my eye. A prize pool of 6 lakhs rupees and not just that a winner will also get a Pre placement offer for Softlink global a logistics company who was also organizing the event. But still wasnât sure to take part  in it as it is scheduled right before my exams. But my friends later my team members somehow convinced me to take part. I also thought what a best way to end my college life. I started winning hackathons from runner up to  third to second but never won first place. Letâs take a shot. So, we DataMiners a group of 4 people participated in the event. The Competition consists of three stages . Every stage was an elimination round. In first round, the team has to submit  a ppt along with a video explanation of how we are going to approach & solve the problem. So I took the charge of it from my team and we submitted the video. And something funny happened that I wish I can reveal. Overall, we got selected in the first round. We got very happy hearing news that we got selected and also shocked that there were 1500+ participants and 565 teams in total who participated for this hackathon. After filtering out from the round1 , 60 teams left for 4 problem statements. And we all were waiting excitedly for the event day which was on 19th April. 


**First Day (19 April)**

As always I reached the location 1.5 hours late registered at the counter took my ID, T-shirt and other goodies & then attended the pre-event talks, understand rules and event timelines. This was a 48 hours hackathon and i never experienced such long event before in my life. Then we were assisted towards the lab and we without wasting a minute  got started working on our project. 

First day that was on Friday spent well me and my team discussed a lot, coded a lot and designed a lot. Thoughtout this day we enjoyed delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have to applaud for the organising team and volunteers they managed everything  so well. At midnight we got to experience the jamming session which really helped our mind to relax and refresh. But just sitting half an hour we headed back to the lab worrying about the next final day. Around 2.30 AM in the night we were told to had snacks. They served Maggi(Noodles) as a midnight snack. I swear thatâs the worst Maggi I ever ate. 3 years old without bun burger >>>> that Maggi. So. I took back all the kind words I said about the organisers. Just Kidding. But yeah that maggi part was true. At 4.00 AM in the night we were walking in the college lobby and clicking photos for absolutely no reason. Then at 5.00 AM i got to sleep. I woke up at 7.30 AM and saw 7 missed calls from my team members I called them back and they said round 2 is about to begin. I rushed to the lab and made my pitching script.


**D-Day**

The judges came and I was prepared to elaborate my script which I rehearsed for like 1000 times. But the judging round didnât go as planned. The judging session becomes so raw that we had such a healthy conversation about and apart from the project. That discussion showed as the clear signs of getting selected for round 3. 

Later, waiting for about 2 hours for results of next round we got to know from volunteers whoever got the call from the organisers are selected for round 3. We waited. Waited for 20 minutes and didnât got any call. We were upset. We packed our bags got in the lift and about to leave the institute. Then my team leader got a call we became very excited that maybe it was the call from the organizers but it was his father and we were upset again. We saw the expression of our team leader he seemed quite happy and we curiously asked him that what happened he replied during registration process his phone number was unavailable so he registered using his fatherâs phone number. So thatâs why his father called and said to him âYou fool where have you gave my number someone called me and said Congratulations your team is selected come to seminar hall for the final round. Donât you dare give my phone number to anyoneâ and hung up the call. We burst out in laughter and got a relief that we were selected for the round 3. 

**Final Round**

Now from total 60 teams of all four problem statements only 16 teams made it to the final round i.e 4 teams from each problem statement. For each p.s, among 4 teams, 1 team will be winner and 1 team will be runner up defeating the other two teams. 

In round 3, for the very first time I had to address such a big crowd from the stage on the mic. CEO of Softlink Global, Judges, Chief guests, Principal, teaching staff, participants, organizers, volunteers and students everyone was present in the audience. 

I got so nervous that I almost started shivering maybe my gut was not feeling well or maybe that Maggi is showing its true colours so before our presentation I gone to washroom stick two fingers in my throat and vomitted. I then washed my face looked in the mirror and said âYouâve already won, just one more roundâ. Now as my steps was reaching towards the backstage for presentation *my heart was beating like a drum*. I reached backstage, revised my lines, made dua for success and step on the stage leaving my fear and anxiety idle on the backstage. 

I stood, delivered, answered and left. Gone out the seminar hall drank a lot of water and took a deep breath and said to myself âYou did your bestâ. After everyoneâs presentation judges discussed and decided the winners.

**Result Time**

At 8.00 PM they started announcing the results. We were in the last problem statement category. i.e ps4. They started announcing results from ps1 in a format of first disclosing the runner up and then the winner. ps1 results announced, ps2 results announced followed by ps3. Now time for our ps i.e ps4. At that moment, we were praying for the runner up position because all the other contestants were also so good that we are limiting our chances of winning the first prize and we were *aiming lower and settling for the minimum.* 


The Speaker announcing the result said âNow for the 4th problem statement runner up goes to â¦â¦â¦..â some other team. We lost hope and taken back seat. After giving the prize to runner up speaker once again came up to stage and said âNow time for the last award of this long night and long 48 hour massive logithon event. The first prize for the problem statement 4 goes toâ¦â¦any guessesâ¦â¦noâ¦..goes to Team DataMiners from Datta Meghe College of Engineering
â. I held my head high stood up and in shock thinking what just happened. Everything in my mind was started happening in slow motion , surrounding noise drops to very low and heart again started beating but this time *beating like a violin*. People around us stood up clapping loudly, whistling, cheering as we make our way upto the stage. We received the cheque, grabbed the trophy and lifted it up high and smiled towards the camera thinking always *aim higher and never settle for the minimum.* I then had good 20-25 mins discussion with the manager of the softlink global and the important takeaway I got from him is **âTomorrow put this victory in the back view mirror of your career and start working towards your next goal.â ** Everyone in my team was calling their parents conveying the good news. But I somehow resisted myself from calling my parents as I wanted to tell them in person.


**Farewell**

We, Collected our certificates and gift hamper and left the college. We felt so fun taking that 1 lakh rupees cheque from the college towards the railway station protecting it from any obstacles like it was now a part of us. I then gone home showed my Mum the certificates, awards, gift hamper, photos and she replied as like every other Universal dialogue of every mother âHave you ate properly throughout the competition?â 

I then washed my face and requested my mum to give me a head massage. And I slept. Slept for 10 long hours and woke up next morning, replied Thank you to everyoneâs messages and started preparing for my exams. 

When I started my college life i volunteered at a SIH hackathon. As a volunteer, I got the opportunity to look at the participants projects, their presentations, team efforts and while providing them their meals I decided that one day I will also be a participant of such a big national hackathon event and I will win it.

And the rest is history.
